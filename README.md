# opnsense-plugin-upstreamproxy
A plugin for when your opnsense firewall must use a proxy to access the internet, and that proxy is not transparent and therefore must be explicitly specified.

This is very alpha at the moment so all that is here is the source code. One day hopefully it will be an os plugin!
